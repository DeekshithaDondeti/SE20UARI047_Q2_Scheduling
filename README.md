# Real World Scheduling Scenerio
Average turn around time of scheduling algorithms(in order of FCFS,SCJ,PS and RR respectively):
[57.5, 50, 55, 71.75]

Average waiting time of scheduling algorithms(in order of FCFS,SCJ,PS and RR respectively): [31.25, 23.75, 28.75, 45.5]

Hence we can see that in this case, the Shortest job first is the most efficient scheduling algorithm.

And the order in which the patients need to be attended to is: A,D,B,C
